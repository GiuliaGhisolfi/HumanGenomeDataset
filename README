# Human Reference Genoma

This repository contains a dataset loaded from the Reference Sequence (RefSeq) Database.

[RefSeq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/) is the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, that contains reference sequences. It is a curated, non-redundant set including genomic DNA contigs, mRNAs, and proteins for known genes, and entire chromosomes.

The dataset was obtained from the RefSeqGene section of the Reference Sequence Database [for Homo sapiens gene](https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/RefSeqGene/).
